### Technologies

- I will use these technologies in the following ways:

- **HTML** - For the structure of the website
- **CSS** - To style the buttons, cards, and other elements
- **JavaScript** - This will be the gears working in the background to run the appropriate functions to run the game
- **Service** - This will manage the requests and data going in and out for the various function calls
- **DB** - This will store the information for login credentials, trivia questions, high scores etc...
- **Login** - To register users and securely store their credentials
- **WebSocket** - Shows new high scores as they come in
- **React** - Ported to the react web framework
